1. One of the parallel arrays that I used in my code was financeOption[], it hold the value 'y' or 'n' as finance option available or not wheras priority[] stores the integer value ranges between 1 to 3 representing the priority of the whishlist. We can notice then that the index of the array is the key to accomplish this, 
because they link consecutively all the arrays together.

2. It is a common practice to iterate arrays initializing the iterator variable to zero because arrays always start with index 0 as a standard in the programming language. Therefore, sticking on it just help the programmers not only to remain consistent but also makes his code lengthy and increase complexity by 1 more iteration.

3. If I want to explain arrays concept to a child of (5-8-year-old), I'll bring 5 different colours of pens and put them in order on a table. Then I'm going to tell him that all this collection of pens that I brought is called an array because they are all pens but with different colours. I'll ask him then to pick a pen, so he will have to go to the location of the chosen pen (index). So I will explain to him later that every pen has its own location in this collection.
