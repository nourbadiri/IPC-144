1. One of the difficult expression that I had in this workshop is %d. During my many attempts of coding, I wasn't able to adjust and align all the columns in the tabular format. Few moments later, I understood that we can fix this problem by adding a number to the sequence depending on how many spaces we have in the tabular.

2. If we took "Mild&&Light" as an example of logical expression, we can analyse it in two different ways but having the same result. The other expression that we can use is "Mild!=Light".

3. In part 1, I think we were asked to use a new variable to calculate the average because we had to use 3 different variables and combine them to get the average. Meanwhile, in part 2, the 3 values were depending to the same variable.
